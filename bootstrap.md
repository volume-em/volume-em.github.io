## Ortho-plane Inference with Bootstrapping

### Overview

Ortho-plane inference is used for isotropic voxel EM data. Independent stacks of
2D predictions on XY, XZ, and YZ planes are averaged into a final 3D segmentation.
This can introduce artifacts like "cross-hatching" that typically would require manual
cleanup. Training a separate DL model with weak supervision (bootstrapping) on the ortho-plane inference
output can significantly improve 3D segmentation quality.
